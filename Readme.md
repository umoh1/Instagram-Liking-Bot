# Welcome to the UITS Instagram Bot!
# This bot can help small business owners get more engaged in their niche by automatically liking pictures under a specific hashtag. 

## How It Works
1. Enter your instagram username & password (passwords are not stored & are discarded after program execution).
2. Enter the hashtag you want to like pictures under. For small business owners, it's preferable that the hashtag is popular & related to your niche for the best results.
3. Enter the amount of pictures you want to like (anywhere between 5 & 500)
4. If you have 2FA, I pause the program for 30 seconds to give you time to put in the 2FA code. If not, the program runs as normal.

## Execution
After inputting the required information & 2FA code (if enabled), you can let the program do the rest. 
The program will open a new Chrome browser window with Instagram in it, and then go through the log in process, search the hashtag, and begin to like the most recent pictures.
The program will continue to run until the inputted amount of pictures have been liked OR the process is killed (manually or accidentally).
